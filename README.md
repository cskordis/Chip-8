# CHIP-8

The software binaries are a collection for the original ETI-660 "ETI-660 Learners' Microcomputer" from Jim Modrouvanos, Marcel van Tongeren and other resources from the Australian electronic publication Electronic Today International, (ETI),  from 1981 - 1984.

The software originally binaries and hexidecimal were converted to intelHex and Wav by python scripts.
The converted wav files have meta data that contains the start and end address for the software.

The python scripts are included in this repository and have easy to follow prompts.
